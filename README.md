## Concept

This is a virtual reality (VR) arcade room in which the player can learn a language while also playing a variety of different minigames. The player progress through levels, each of them composed of several modules based on different language topics, for example, parts of speech such as verbs, or more general topics like seasons of the year or common phrases. 

The player completes each module by playing a variety of language learning games, such as a Skee-Ball Language Quiz in which properly selecting the correct answer allows the player to play a round of the game to earn points and compete for a high score. Successfully completing all of the modules in a level allows the user to progress. 

### Skee-Ball Game

One of the games available is a Skee-Ball game, very similar to what you can find in arcades and bars everywhere. This game has a twist though, that facilitates the language learning component. In order to get a ball deposited, the player must correctly answer a language question. 

Doing so incorrectly will simply proceed to the next question, but answering correctly will provide a ball for the player and allow them to roll it down the table in an attempt to get points. 

Currently, the Skee-Ball machine consists of one round of 5 different questions, but conceptually the machine would allow the user to get different questions (and a different number of questions) based on the currently selected module.

### Grabbing Machine Game

The other game available is a Grabbing Machine, very similar to what you can find in arcades everywhere.  

Currently, the grabbing machine consists of one round of 4 different animals name to guess, but conceptually the machine would allow the user to get different words based on the currently selected module.
